NOTE: This list is new will hopefully grow rapidly. I would like to move towards
      making Elemental (and my other open source efforts) closer to 
      publications.

    "The spectral decomposition of nonsymmetric matrices on distributed memory
    parallel computers", SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, Vol. 18, No. 5,
    1997.  

    NOTE: The proposed algorithm will likely be implemented in the near future.

    algorithms related to the inversion of a Symmetric Positive Definite 
    matrix", ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 35, Issue 1, 
    pp. 3:1--3:22, 2008.

    NOTE: The variant 2 single-sweep algorithm from Fig. 9 was parallelized for
          Elemental's HPD inversion.

    Householder transformations", Numerische Mathematik, Vol. 7, pp. 269--276,
    1965.

    NOTE: This paper introduced the Businger-Golub algorithm for column-pivoted
          QR decompositions.

    optimization", Foundations of Computational Mathematics, Vol. 9, Issue 6, 
    pp. 717--772, 2009.

    NOTE: This paper is used for the definition of the coherence of a subspace
          with respect to the standard unit basis vectors.

[ ] Tony F. Chan, "An improved algorithm for computing the Singular Value
    Decomposition", ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 8, Issue 1, 
    pp. 72--83, 1982.
    http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/courses/324/chan.pdf

    NOTE: This paper introduced the idea of using a QR decomposition as a first
          step in the SVD of a non-square matrix in order to accelerate the 
          computation (well, an earlier Golub paper mentioned it as well).

[ ] Jiawei Chiu and Laurent Demanet, "Sublinear randomized algorithms for 
    skeleton decompositions", Technical Report, MIT, 2011.
    http://math.mit.edu/icg/papers/sublinear-skeleton.pdf

    NOTE: Contains a thorough analysis of many randomized algorithms for 
          (pseudoskeleton) decompositions using RRQR factorizations.

    "Fast Linear Algebra is Stable", Numer. Math., Vol. 108, no. 1, pp. 59--91,
    2007.

    NOTE: Modern reference for divide and conquer schemes for the nonsymmetric
          eigenvalue problem. For instance, this paper suggests multiplication
          of the rank-deficient projector against a Haar matrix as a means of
          computing the rank-revealing factorization. This was discussed along
          the way of the main goal of the paper: showing that fast matrix-matrix
          multiplication can be extended to the major linear algebra operations.

[ ] Zlatko Drmac and Zvonimir Bujanovic, "On the failure of rank revealing QR
    factorization software -- a case study", LAPACK Working Note 176, 2006.

    NOTE: Elemental uses the same norm updating strategy as this paper and the
          corresponding LAPACK implementation of dgeqpf.f

    least squares solutions", Numerische Mathematik, Vol. 14, No. 5,

          also referred to as CUR decompositions, especially when the center
          matrix is non-square.

          hopefully be added to Elemental in the near future.

     NOTE: This could serve as a foundation for achieving high absolute accuracy
           in a cross-product based algorithm for computing the SVD. Such an
           approach should be more scalable than the current 
           bidiagonalization-based approach.

          matrices, e.g., within the spectral divide-and-conquer scheme 
          described in "Fast Linear Algebra is Stable".
